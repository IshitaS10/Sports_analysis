# Enhanced Sports Analysis

In modern sports analytics, the ability to track players, referees, and the ball in real-time provides invaluable insights into performance, tactics, and overall gameplay. This research presents a robust system for object detection and tracking in sports using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and ByteTrack. The system is designed to identify key objects such as players, referees, and the ball within game footage, track their movement, and offer detailed performance analysis. By utilizing advanced deep learning models for real-time detection, we generate heatmaps to visualize player movement and identify patterns in player positioning. The integration of these analytical tools not only helps in performance evaluation but also in decision-making processes related to strategy formulation. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of computer vision techniques in sports analytics, providing a pathway for further advancements in performance evaluation technologies.
